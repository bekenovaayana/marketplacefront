Specification 
Title 
Full-Stack Marketplace Platform 
Objective 
Design and build a production-style marketplace platform that includes: - a Flutter 
mobile application for end users, - a FastAPI backend with well-structured REST APIs, - a 
MySQL database with strong relational design, - and an admin panel for moderation, 
operations, analytics, and platform control. 
This project is intended for top-tier, carefully selected students. It is not a toy 
assignment. The submission must reflect the thinking and execution quality expected from 
a junior engineer who can soon become production-capable. 
The platform must feel like a real startup product that could plausibly be launched with 
further polishing. 
1. Product Scenario 
Students must build a marketplace-style system in which users can: - register and 
authenticate, - create, edit, and manage posts/listings, - upload and manage listing media, - browse and search listings, - filter and sort listings, - view public owner/seller 
information, - view all listings of a particular owner, - save favorite listings, - message other 
users, - send attachments inside messages, - report listings or users, - manage language 
preferences, - pay for platform features, - purchase promotions such as 
targeting/boosting, - view notifications, - and manage their account/profile. 
Administrators must be able to: - manage users, - manage categories and attributes, - 
moderate listings, - inspect conversations when needed for abuse handling, - review 
reports, - manage payments, - manage promotions, - manage featured/boosted content, - 
manage language content, - monitor analytics and operational dashboards, - and review 
audit trails. 
The platform may be themed as one of the following: - car marketplace, - real estate 
marketplace, - service marketplace, - electronics marketplace, - general classified 
marketplace. 
Students may choose the domain, but the feature set must remain complete and 
coherent. 
2. Timeframe and Intent 
Duration 

Goal of the assignment 
This assignment measures: - engineering maturity, - architecture quality, - execution under 
time constraints, - product sense, - code cleanliness, - backend discipline, - database 
modeling, - mobile UI/UX quality, - and ability to build an end-to-end system. 
This is intentionally ambitious. Reviewers do not expect every advanced feature to be 
perfect, but they do expect the student to: - choose a correct architecture, - implement the 
important flows fully, - and make intelligent trade-offs. 
A submission should feel like “a serious MVP built by a strong engineer”, not a 
classroom demo.
